# Accurate and Efficient Elevator Button Localization

Welcome to the OCR-RCNN-v2 repository! This project is designed for autonomous elevator manipulation, enabling robots to autonomously operate previously unvisited elevators. This repository contains the perception part of the project, based on our initial publication: [A Novel OCR-RCNN for Elevator Button Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594071). In this version, we've improved accuracy by 20% and achieved a real-time running speed of ~10 FPS (640x480) on a graphics card (â‰¥ GTX950). We've also tested it on a laptop with a GTX950M (2GB memory), achieving a running speed of ~6 FPS. We're currently working on optimizing the TX2 version for faster performance, which will be released soon along with the dataset and post-processing code.

## Requirements

To run OCR-RCNN-v2, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04
- **Python Version:** 3.8
- **Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow 2.3.0
  - Numpy 1.18.5

## Installation

For running on laptops and desktops (x86_64), follow these steps:

1. Install necessary libraries:
    ```sh
    sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
    ```
2. Install Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install tensorflow==2.3.0
    pip install numpy==1.18.5
    pip install protobuf==3.19.6
    pip install pillow matplotlib lxml imageio --user
    pip install pyrealsense2
    ```

## Inference

To run the inference, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/annaayeon/ocr-rcnn-v2.git
    ```
2. Run the inference script:
    ```sh
    cd ocr-rcnn-v2
    python inference_640x480.py
    ```

We hope you find this project useful for your autonomous elevator manipulation tasks. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to open an issue on this repository. Happy coding!
